ðŸ‘€ Hi, This is XaVI, an open source semiconductor intellectual property micro-processor.

XaVI = XVI + a:
- a tiny ultra-low-power 16-bit processor 
- for analog/mixed-signal applications.

This will provide:
- an open source Verilog RTL code for synthesis to FPGA or ASIC, and
- an open source toolchain, as well as
- an open source instruction set
which will be available free for commercial as well as academic and personal use.

It's early days.
