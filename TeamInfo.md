## EDA Tools ##

Open Source / free tools:
- FPGA implementation: [Intel Quartus Prime Lite](https://fpgasoftware.intel.com/?edition=lite)
- Verilog Simulation: (within Intel Quartus) Modelsim, within 'Intel FPGA standard edition' rather than v21.0 or later with Questa.
- ASIC Implementation: [Open-ROAD](https://theopenroadproject.org/), including Yosys for synthesis.
